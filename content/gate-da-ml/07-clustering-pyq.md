Euclidean distance based $k$-means clustering algorithm was run on a dataset of 100 points with $k = 3$.\ If the points $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ are both part of cluster 3, then which ONE of the following points is necessarily also part of cluster 3?
- **(A)** $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- **(B)** $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$
- **(C)** $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
- **(D)** $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

**Answer:** D

In the following table, the Task column lists a few tasks related to machine learning.\ The Algorithm column lists a few algorithms.\ Each entry ``t'' from the Task column is to be matched with an appropriate entry ``a'' from the Algorithm column such that the task ``t'' can be solved using the algorithm ``a''.

| **Task** | **Algorithm** |
| --- | --- |
| T1 -- Clustering | A1 -- Markov Chain Monte Carlo |
| T2 -- Classification | A2 -- K-Medoid |
| T3 -- Sampling | A3 -- Linear Discriminant Analysis |
| T4 -- Feature Extraction | A4 -- Naive Bayes |

Which of the following options is/are the correct matching(s)?
- **(A)** T1:A4, T2:A3, T3:A1, T4:A2
- **(B)** T1:A2, T2:A4, T3:A1, T4:A3
- **(C)** T1:A3, T2:A4, T3:A1, T4:A2
- **(D)** T1:A2, T2:A3, T3:A4, T4:A1

**Answer:** B

<!-- FIGURE NEEDED: Original question references a figure from the GATE paper -->

Consider the table below, where the $(i, j)$-th element of the table is the distance between points $x_i$ and $x_j$.\ Single linkage clustering is performed on data points $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$.

|  | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $x_1$ | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 6 |
| $x_2$ | 1 | 0 | 3 | 5 | 3 |
| $x_3$ | 4 | 3 | 0 | 2 | 5 |
| $x_4$ | 3 | 5 | 2 | 0 | 1 |
| $x_5$ | 6 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 0 |

Which ONE of the following is the correct representation of the clusters produced?

(Options show different dendrogram structures --- see original paper for diagrams.)

**Answer:** A

Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two sets of objects.\ Let $D(x, y)$ be a measure of dissimilarity between two objects $x$ and $y$.\ Consider the following definitions of dissimilarity between $C_1$ and $C_2$:
$$
\text{DIS-1}(C_1, C_2) = \max_{x \in C_1, y \in C_2} D(x, y)
$$
$$
\text{DIS-2}(C_1, C_2) = \min_{x \in C_1, y \in C_2} D(x, y)
$$
Which of the following statements is/are correct?
- **(A)** Single Linkage Clustering uses DIS-1
- **(B)** Single Linkage Clustering uses DIS-2
