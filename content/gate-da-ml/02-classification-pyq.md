## Q5037

[NAT]
[PYQ: GATE DA 2026]

Consider the model $\hat{y} = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2$ with weights $\mathbf{w} = (w_1, w_2) = (1, 2)$ and regularization parameter $\lambda = 0.5$. The training data and predictions are:

| $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $y$ | $\hat{y} = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 1 | 3 | 4 |
| 1 | 2 | 4 | 5 |

Compute the ridge loss $L = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i| + \lambda(w_1^2 + w_2^2)$ (rounded to 1 decimal place).

**Answer:** 5.5

## Q5041

[MSQ]
[PYQ: GATE DA 2025]

Consider a two-class problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with class labels red and green. Let $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{red}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{green}}$ be the means of the two classes. Given test sample $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, a classifier calculates the squared Euclidean distance between $\mathbf{x}$ and the means of the two classes and assigns the class label that the sample $\mathbf{x}$ is closest to. That is, the classifier computes
$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \norm{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{red}} - \mathbf{x}}^2 - \norm{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{green}} - \mathbf{x}}^2
$$
and assigns the label red to $\mathbf{x}$ if $f(\mathbf{x}) < 0$, and green otherwise. Which of the following statements is/are correct?

- **(A)** The sample $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ is assigned the label green if $\norm{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{red}}} < \norm{\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{green}}}$
- **(B)** $f$ is a linear function of $\mathbf{x}$
- **(C)** $f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x} + b$, where $\mathbf{w}$ and $b$ are functions of $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{red}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{green}}$
- **(D)** $f$ is a quadratic polynomial in $\mathbf{x}$

**Answer:** B, C
