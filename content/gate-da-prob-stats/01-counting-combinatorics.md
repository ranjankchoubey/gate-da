## Q013

[MCQ]

In a version of the computer language BASIC, the name of a variable is a string of one or two alphanumeric characters, where uppercase and lowercase letters are not distinguished. (An alphanumeric character is either one of the 26 English letters or one of the 10 digits.) Moreover, a variable name must begin with a letter and must be different from the five strings of two characters that are reserved for programming use. How many different variable names are there in this version of BASIC?

- **(A)** $26 + 36^2$
- **(B)** $26 + 26 * 36 - 5$
- **(C)** $26 * 36 + 26^2$
- **(D)** $26 + 931$

**Answer:** D

## Q015

[NAT]

**Counting Internet Addresses:** How many diﬀerent IPv4 addresses are available for computers on the Internet?

Three forms of addresses are used, with diﬀerent numbers of bits used for netids and hostids.
**Class A addresses**, used for the largest networks, consist of 0, followed by a 7-bit netid and a 24-bit hostid. 
**Class B addresses**, used for medium-sized networks, consist of 10, followed by a 14-bit netid and a 16-bit hostid. 
**Class C addresses**, used for the smallest networks, consist of 110, followed by a 21-bit netid and an 8-bit hostid. 

There are several restrictions on addresses because of **special uses**: 1111111 is not available as the netid of a **Class A network**, and the hostids consisting of all 0s and all 1s are not available for use in **any network**.


**Class D addresses** reserved for use in multicasting when multiple computers are addressed at a single time, consisting of 1110 followed by 28 bits.

**Class E addresses** reserved for future use, consisting of 11110 followed by 27 bits. 

**NOTE :** Neither Class D nor Class E addresses are assigned as the IPv4 address of a computer on the Internet.
